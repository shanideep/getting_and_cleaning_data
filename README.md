Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Load the activity and feature info
Load training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merge those columns with the dataset
Append test and train data
Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt
